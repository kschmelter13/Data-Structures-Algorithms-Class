# Data-Structures-Algorithms-Class
Work from my data structures and algorithms class

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

- For the projects in the course we were tasked with loading a file with course information on computer science courses and storing that information in different data structures and evaluating which would be the best for that purpose.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- I approached the problem by understanding the data structures I would be using and understanding the format the file needed to be parsed and checked for. Data structures are extremely important because they allow for an efficient and more managed way for data storage to be done.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- One roadblock that I did have was when trying to alphanumerically sort the hash table. I wasn't entirely sure of the process that was supposed to be done but came to the conclusion that I should create a list and store the hash tables elements in it. I then sorted the list and printed it out.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- Working on this project has helped me understand that there are better ways to store data and it is important to understand the best and most efficient way to use it for your implementation.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- When building projects and designing software now I have a preemptive thought process to how the data is going to be stored and how it will be accessed and what is the best way for that to be done.
